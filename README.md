# FIT2097 Game Jam - Golf Dungeon
This is a simple adventure game where you can shoot the ball using the mouse.     
This was developed during the game jam session of the FIT2097 unit. 

It was developed using Unreal Engine using C++ and blueprints with my partner     
Janet Suryadi.

## Controls

You can use the mouse scroll to zoom in/out to get a better view.
